        <p>Train to keep your total meals to no less than 3 times and no more than 5 times per day.</p>
        <p>STRIVE FOR EATING NO MORE THAN FIVE TIMES A DAY!</p>
        <p>Add one day's worth of Emoji Points and always divide by 5 (for the 5 times you are supposed to eat) to see how you are doing for the day.</p>
        <p>Example 1. ¬†A One Day Example May look like this:</p>
        <p>Monday (5 Meals) üòè +2 üòê +1 üòç +5 üòã +4 üòÉ +3 = 15</p>
        <p>15 is good because 15/5 = 3. ¬†For good control, an average of about 3 is where you want to be, not too much less and not too much more.</p>
        <p>Example 2. ¬†A One Week Example May look like this:</p>
        <p>15 Emoji Points per day (Average 3 pleasure rating for each of 5 Meals) X 7 days in a week= 105</p>
        <p>Add the Emoji Points for the 7 days of a week. ¬†The Optimal Total Emoji Points per week = 105.</p>
